In a quiet village nestled between two hills, a boy named Aarav discovered a rusted radio buried beneath an old banyan tree. When he turned the dial, it did not play music- it whispered forgotten dreams. Each night, villagers gathered as Aarav tuned in, and the radio shared stories of their ancestors, lost hopes, and secret wishes. One evening, it spoke Aarav’s own dream aloud: to build a school where every child could learn freely. Inspired, the village rallied. Bricks replaced whispers. Years later, the banyan still stood, but now beside it rose a school—built from stories, powered by dreams, and echoing with laughter.
